NIGERIAN MICROFINANCE PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS
Executive Summary

Date: February 8, 2026
Analyst: Chegwe Favour
Portfolio Size: ₦271.6M | 3,922 Loans | 14-Month Analysis Period

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

The ₦271.6M loan portfolio demonstrates strong collection performance (93.5%) but 
faces elevated default risk (14.6%) driven by geographic concentration and customer selection. 
Analysis reveals clear patterns: repeat borrowers show 4.2x lower default rates than first-time
customers, and Southern regions outperform Northern regions 2:1. Strategic reallocation and 
operational improvements can reduce defaults to 11.8% and increase annual profit by ₦8-10M.

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

Month 1-3:
✓ Exit North East market
✓ Begin hiring process (24 officers)
✓ Audit Feb 2025 vintage
✓ Implement risk-based pricing

Month 4-6:
✓ Complete officer onboarding
✓ Launch customer retention program
✓ Introduce seasonal underwriting
✓ Deploy loan amount caps

Month 7-12:
✓ Portfolio rebalancing to 85% South
✓ Quarterly performance reviews
✓ Continuous optimization
✓ Monitor vintage performance trends

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RISK MITIGATION

Implementation Risks:
• North East exit may face regulatory scrutiny
  → Mitigation: Engage regulators early, provide customer transition support

• Officer hiring timeline (24 hires in 6 months)
  → Mitigation: Partner with recruitment agencies, offer competitive packages

• Customer pushback on risk-based pricing
  → Mitigation: Grandfather existing customers, phase in over 3 months

Portfolio Risks:
• Further quality deterioration in Q1 2025 cohorts
  → Mitigation: Monthly vintage monitoring, immediate corrective action

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CONCLUSION

The portfolio exhibits strong operational fundamentals (93.5% collection) undermined by 
strategic allocation errors. The path forward is clear: exit underperforming markets, 
expand in proven geographies, and leverage the 4.2x risk advantage of repeat customers. 
This data-driven reallocation will reduce defaults by 2.8 percentage points and generate ₦8-10M 
in additional annual profit while maintaining responsible lending standards.

The microfinance relationship model works—we need to deploy it where conditions allow it to succeed.
